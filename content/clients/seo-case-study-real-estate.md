Each search engine — Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc — has an [algorithm that crawls online web pages](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/crawling-indexing/) to determine which results to show people when they search for any given keyword phrase (i.e. the words they type into the search engine).

By optimizing your own real estate website page(s) for a search engine’s algorithm (usually Google since it’s the biggest), you can rank for high-value phrases and drive passive traffic to your website.
