The Skin Room Naples is Floridaâ€™s premier destination for medical-grade skin treatments in Naples and the surrounding Southwest Florida areas. Erica Current hired Fulcrum to design/develop a website where customers could locate her business, send inquires about services, and review products used by The Skin Room. 

How did we do it? 

All projects start with a consultation to review project goals and objectives. The first phase is important to gather design cues and learn about the client. Erica had a vision for this project and provided other websites she liked. This helped us construct an outline, explaining how each page is navigated and what features each page includes.
