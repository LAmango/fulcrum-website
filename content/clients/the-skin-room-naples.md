The Skin Room Naples is Floridaâ€™s premier destination for medical-grade skin treatments in Naples and the surrounding Southwest Florida areas. Erica Current hired Fulcrum to design/develop a website where customers could locate her business, send inquires about services, and review products used by The Skin Room. In addition, you can purchase products from her website and shipped to your door! 

How did we do it? 

All projects start with a consultation to review project goals and objectives. The first phase is important to gather design cues and learn about the client. Erica had a vision for this project and provided other websites she liked. This helped us construct an outline, explaining how each page is navigated and what features each page includes. 

Over the last year, The Skin Room has evolved into a top-tier skincare clinic. Her digital customer base has grown by over 200%! 

If you're an aesthetician looking to showcase your products and services, contact us today for a free consultation!
