So far we have 3 crucial tips for a business. Just like Thanos, character in the Marvel movies, he needed 5 infinity stones to complete his power. Today, I bring you the 4th of our "infinity stones" for a business. We will be talking about the almighty social media! The greatest power in our generation. It seems overwhelming to use with their being so many platforms to choose from, but they are all user friendly. You could also hire someone within your business to maintain and post for all of your accounts if you feel that is needed.

Think about how much technology has evolved. People are glued to their phones all day. I can't say I'm innocent, but it's true. Especially during this quarantine. People use social media for a lot of things. 

* Tech Support
* Business reviews
* Promoting themselves/business
* Engaging with others
* News

The list can go on and on, but for businesses specifically, you're building tremendous awareness and engaging with your customers. This is also a great way to increase your customer base and communicate with customers directly. Sites like Twitter and Facebook are free to use!

For Facebook, if you want to pay some money, you can do something called "Boosting" your posts. Depending on your audience, the cost can vary. We've found it to be very effective considering how many ads people see on a daily basis.

If you guys have any questions regarding social media, or just want to reach out to learn more feel free to contact us! Make sure to check out our pages on Twitter and Facebook if you would like an example of how these sites work and operate. Stay tuned next week for our final tip!
