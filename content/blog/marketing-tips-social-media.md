So far we have 3 crucial tips for a business. Just like Thanos, character in the Marvel movies, he needed 5 infinity stones to complete his power. Today, I bring you the 4th of our "infinity stones" for a business. We will be talking about the almighty social media! The greatest power in our generation. It seem overwhelming to use 

Think about how much technology has evolved. People are glued to their phones all day. I can't say I'm innocent, but it's true. Especially during this quarantine. People use social media for a lot of things. 

* Tech Support
* Business reviews
* Promoting themselves/business
* Engaging with others
* News

The list can go on and on, but for businesses specifically, you're building awareness for your customers. The engagement aspect is also tremendous. This is a great way to increase your customer base and communicate with customers directly. Sites like Twitter and Facebook are free to use!
