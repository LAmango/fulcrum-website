# **What are Trademarks and Copyrights!** 

Fulcrum Design and Marketing has been hard at work creating another website! We were recently asked about trademarks and if they're necessary for your business. Trademarks consist of any text, design, phrase, or symbol that explicitly identifies your business, which can be protected under trademark laws. While you do not technically need to register an active trademark, you may only be protected within your local area. 

# **Do I need a trademark or copyright?** 

## Size of your business

You're running a mid-sized successful business in the city with plenty of competition. You've paid Fulcrum Design and Marketing to create your logo and marketing material for your business. You might want to protect your investment and brand from copycats. With the emergence of eCommerce, duplicate businesses are becoming more common. If your business operates in a small geographic area, you can hold off on copyrights and trademarks. If your business has similar competition in a large geographic area, setting up copyrights, trademarks and search engine optimization can be essential when emerging from competition. 

## Copyright

According to the U.S. Copyright office, copyrights protect original works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software and architecture. Fulcrum Design and Marketing can create a website tailored to your needs. With our experience in software development business solutions, we are able to add copyrights and maintaining the integrity of your original work. 

Let us know if copyrights and trademarks are important to you. Need an answer? Send a question!
