Last week we talked about the importance of customer focus. Making the customer the center of your business is a lot easier than you think. We hope our tips helped you out!

For our next tip we will be discussing two significant pieces in a business; recommendations and reviews. Your friends, family, clients, and employees are all huge assets for the initial growth of your business. Without them, you'll be putting in a lot of extra work. Being honest and friendly with your customers will take you a long way. The best part about that is it's FREE! By having them involved in this, you should see an increase in success for your business. 

Getting the word out about your business is going to help it grow dramatically. Whether it be through:

* Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, Google Reviews, Trip Advisor etc.)
* Customers talking about your business to other people
* Customer referral programs

Encourage your customers to write reviews!! Like we keep stressing, customers are HUGE in your business. It will help you grow. Customer reviews increase the chance of a new customer wanting to inquire about your business.

All of our tips go hand in hand. So far we've talked about customer focus and recommendations and reviews. Stay tuned next week for our third tip for your business and be sure to check out our page!
