Last week we talked about the importance of customer focus. Making the customer the center of your business is a lot easier than you think. We hope our tips helped you out!

For our next tip we will be discussing two significant pieces in a business, and that's recommendations and reviews. Your friends, family, clients, employees are all huge parts of this process. Without them, you'll have to be putting in a lot of extra work. Being honest and friendly with your customers will take you a long way. Best part about that is it's FREE! Just doing that will increase your recommendations and reviews for your business. Respond to customer inquiries ASAP

Getting the word out about your business is going to help it grow dramatically. Whether it be through:

* Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, etc.)
* People talking about your business
* Customer referral programs
