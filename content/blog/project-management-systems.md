# Welcome back to our #FulcrumBlogs! 

Good morning, my name is Hezron Edwards, Head of Business Applications for Fulcrum Websites and Marketing. My job is to provide the best experience and knowledge to our customers. 

In today's post, we will be discussing a new software called **Fulcrum Portals**, created in house by Head of Software Development, Lucas Albano. 

## What is **Fulcrum Portals**?

**Fulcrum Portals** is a simple yet effective project management software used to organize your customer or team data. **Fulcrum Portals** improves team collaboration and work management. Having a successful business always starts with an organized team! 

## What problem does it solve?

In order for a project manager to achieve their goals in the organization, they require reliable systems with little learning curve. Globalization has caused a saturation of project management software and creating vast amount of competition. This leads to the overcomplicated applications you see today. **Fulcrum Portals** is a simple, effective, and customizable. 

Example: Fulcrum Websites and Marketing needed a better way to communicate goals and progress with it's team. We wanted a project management system our team is familiar with. By creating Fulcrum Portals, we can saves time in the review process. The custom project management system we created allows us to upload the website into Fulcrum Portals viewable in mobile, desktop, and tablet form. Before completing the website our team reviews the UX Design, functionality, and content. Fulcrum Portals allows feedback from not only the team but the website customer. We enjoy this feature because we want our customers to be involved.
