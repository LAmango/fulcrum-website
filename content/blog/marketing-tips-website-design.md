Happy Wednesday! Hope everyone is safe and sound during this crazy time. Be sure to message us on either our website, Twitter @FulcrumWebsites, or Facebook @fulcrumdm for any questions or inquiries.

We are back with some marketing tips! We will be discussing Website Design and the importance of it. People do not prioritize design and functionality. Online shopping and surfing is huge, especially with the way technology is going.

* Have a plan
* Usability (Menu and buttons easy to navigate)
* Contact information included
* Colors
* Pictures and Graphics
* Mobile friendly
* Simple layout
* Don't be afraid of white space

We use specific coding and designs for our website content to make sure it is top tier. Some people like to use sites like Wix, Weebly, Strikingly, etc. That comes with some risks though. For an example:

* Slow performance
* Lack of flexibility
* Normally just a "free" trial
* Data privacy
* Ads
* Unprofessional website address

If you guys need any professional help with creating a website or need more tips, feel free to contact us! We are here to help everyone.<https://www.facebook.com/fulcrumdm>Happy Wednesday!
