Happy Monday everyone. Hope everyone is safe and well during this crazy time.  Be sure to message us on either our website, Twitter @FulcrumWebsites, or Facebook @fulcrumdm for any questions or inquiries. 

We're back with some marketing tips!! We'll be discussing your Website design and the importance of it. People don't make it much of a priority as it should be. Online shopping and surfing is huge! Especially with the way technology is going. 

* Have a plan!!!
* Usability (Menu and buttons easy to navigate) 
* Contact information included
* Colors
* Pictures and Graphics 
* Mobile friendly
* Simple layout
* Don't be afraid of white space

We use specific coding and designs for our website content to make sure it's top tier. Some people like to use sites like Wix, Weebly, Strikingly, etc. That comes with some risks though. For an example

* Slow performance
* Normally just a "free" trial
* Data privacy
* Ads
* Unprofessional website address
